This week's data is all about SF Housing and Rentals. The github page for this can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-07-05). There are three datasets made available:

  - **rent.csv**. Bay Area Rentals posts (via Craigslist) that dates back to 2000.

  - **sf_permits.csv**. SF building permits.

  - **new_construction.csv**. Yearly Bay Area net new housing construction.

All data is first loaded from tidytuesday using the tidytuesdayR package before further cleaning.

This data has been made available by [Kate Pennington](https://www.katepennington.org/data).
