This dataset comes from Craigslist posts for Bay Area rentals. To get historical data Kate Pennington utilized [the Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), and scraped the archived Craigslist posts.  

To further clean the dataset, I converted the date variable to a date from a numeric. I found the post_id contained the unique ID number as well as a categorical value of "pre2013", which I've separated out.

After looking through the dataset, it seems that most listings do not have the address and/or the lat/lon included.  It seems that we will have to rely on the neighborhood (nhood), city and county variables to determine the rental location.

  tuesdata$rent %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date),
         era = case_when(
           post_id %>% str_detect("^pre2013") ~ "Pre-2013",
           TRUE ~ "Post-2013"),
         id = post_id %>% str_replace("^pre2013_", "")) %>%
  select(id, era, everything(), -post_id) %>%
  arrange(date, nhood, city, county)
```
