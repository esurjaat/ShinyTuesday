There was not much documentation on this dataset. I could not seem to find the data through the [VitalSigns]() link provided. Taking a closer look at the cleaning script provided on the [tidytuesday github post](), it seems to refer to a different url that is blocked behind a subscription paywall (carto.com). The latter seems to be the api used to initially download this data, while the former is a summary based on this data.

To clean the data, I removed *the_geom* and *the_geom_webmercator* columns as they only contained NA values.  The *county* column values all ended with "County", which I've removed due to redundancy and have transformed it into a factor. The *year* column was left as a numeric, which I've transformed to a date (using Jan 1 as the default).

```{r prep, results = 'asis', eval = FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tidytuesdayR)

# Load via github
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(x = "2022-07-05")

# New Construction
new_construction <-
  tuesdata$new_construction %>%
  mutate(
    county =
      county %>%
      str_replace(" County$", "") %>%
      forcats::as_factor(),
    year = paste0(year,"0101") %>% ymd()
    ) %>%
  select(-c(the_geom, the_geom_webmercator))
```
