The *sf_permits* data lists all building permits for San Francisco dating back to 2000. 
All permits are listed regardless of status (e.g. expired, complete). The data seems mostly complete 
without and missing block and lot data as well as permit type and status.

To clean this data I only changed a number of variables from character to factor and 
some variables from numeric to character. The variable *status_concise* was added to simplify 
the status variable, boiling down the 16 various statuses down to three: approved, 
rejected, and pending.

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(x = "2022-07-05")

# SF Permits
sf_permits <-
  tuesdata$sf_permits %>%
  mutate(
    across(.cols = c(permit_type, existing_construction_type, proposed_construction_type),
           .fns = ~factor(.x)),
    across(.cols = c(permit_number, zipcode, record_id), .fns = ~as.character(.x)),
    status_concise = case_when(
      status %in% c("appeal", "issued", "issuing", "plancheck",
                    "reinstated", "filed") ~ "pending",
      status %in% c("approved", "complete") ~ "approved",
      status %in% c("cancelled", "denied", "disapproved", "expired",
                    "overruled", "revoked", "suspend", "withdrawn") ~ "rejected",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    ))
```
