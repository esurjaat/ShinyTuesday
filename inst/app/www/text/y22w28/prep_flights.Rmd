The **flights** data is aggregated by the number of flights (broken out by 'departing', 'arriving' & 'total') by day per airport. The data dates back to 2016, but not all airports have flight traffic data that goes back that far.  As the data is clean already, all I have done to this data frame is clean up the column names using the *janitor* package.

```{r prep_flights, results='asis', eval=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(janitor)

# Load via Github
tuesday <-
  "2022-07-12" %>%
  tidytuesdayR::tt_load()

# Euro Flights
flights <-
  tuesday$flights %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```
