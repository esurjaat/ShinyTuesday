[ShinyTuesday](https://esurjaat.shinyapps.io/shinytuesday/) is my
personal project that follows
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly
social data project in R.

My participation on these weekly posts can be found in this Shiny App.
Each post will have their own section in the sidebar. This project
showcases how data analysis can be presented in an interactive format.
